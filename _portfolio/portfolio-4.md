In this project, it was aimed to enable users to perform their transactions using a mobile application on a blockchain-based data sharing platform, and a prototype had to be made in a very short time for this.
First of all, I decided to create scenarios for the application and the pages to be created and the information to be kept. Then I wrote the application from beginning to end with help from open source projects, suitable for connecting with firebase or integrating with api in the future. I then tried the app on different phones to make sure it works without any problems.
Thanks to this mobile application that emerged at the end of 2.3 days, the owner of the idea was able to convey his idea to the other party in a much better way, and it is open to application development and can choose the option to use this prototype as its main application in the future, as the API is prepared in accordance with the firebase integration also In this limited time, in addition to this mobile application, I also developed a web application with Flutter-Web for the project
