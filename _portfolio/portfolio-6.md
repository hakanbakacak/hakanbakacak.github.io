A C # desktop application prepared using MSSQL database. Within the scope of this project, I gave importance to preparing a project in accordance with the rules of object-oriented programming approach and tried to add appropriate design patterns. I tried to prepare a suitable system for features that can be added to the project later. In addition, we used git version control system to coordinate with my teammates. As a result of the project, I learned many things about database insert, update delete select operations, and at the same time, I realized the positive effects of coding in accordance with the object-oriented approach on teamwork. I had the opportunity to see how UML diagrams are improving the project processes.
