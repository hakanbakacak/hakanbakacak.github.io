This project is a web application prepared for the ESOGU Database Management Systems course by collaborating with the [Okkasoft](http://www.okkasoft.com/) company. It aims to bring Employers and Employees together by scanning people's github and stackoverflow profiles. In this project, asp.net firemework is used with MVC pattern and MSSQL is used as a relational database. While designing the database, emphasis has been placed on the fact that new platforms can be added to the project in the future and that new evaluation criteria can be added. In addition, a field called scoreMultiple has been added to determine the weights of the evaluation criteria.
