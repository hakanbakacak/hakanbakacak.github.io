This repo contains the mobile application prototype codes of our Digital Service Project called Seyir, which we developed with my teammates within the scope of Turkcell Unlimited Talent program. During the 1-week project development process, first an idea was found, then various analyzes and marketing strategies were created and the mobile application was designed. The mobile application [**design**](https://www.figma.com/proto/VSC4tNCpSh5GY3r5qfM8E9/Seyir-App?node-id=83%3A329&viewport=-269%2C322%2C0.2075285017490387&scaling=scale-down) was made by Enes Alıoğlu via figma. This design has been implemented with Flutter.
