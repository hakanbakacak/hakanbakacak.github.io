The purpose of this application is to present the chemistry formulas and the features of the elements to the users in the most understandable and simplest form. In practice, it is aimed to help the user to focus on the formulas or elements by avoiding the distracting elements as much as possible. It is designed to be used for different courses and different subjects in the future. My biggest contribution to this project was in simplifying the code and designing it for the future. Keeping the formulas and element features in JSON format has increased the reusability of the code, and it will also not upset the software developers who will work on the code as it is written in accordance with object-oriented programming principles.
As a result, a simple, convenient and simple application has emerged, which is prepared in a way that does not distract the users and is easy to adjust to present information in different disciplines if desired. In addition, since the application was written with Flutter, the time to be spent running it on devices with android and ios operating systems was considerably reduced.
