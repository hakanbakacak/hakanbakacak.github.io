Hi,
My name is Hakan. I graduated from ASO Technical College Departmant of Industrial Automation Technologies. I took basic mechatronics training there. I have worked on various robotics projects and participated in robotics competitions. Now, I am last year computer engineering student at Eskisehir Osmangazi University, and also working as a researcher in [BILDAM](http://bildam.ogu.edu.tr/). I am interested in machine learning and Flutter.

I am currently working on my Thermal Camera Emotion Detection project at Bildam, which is also supported by TUBITAK, and at the same time, I am doing data visualization and interpretation studies on biometric sensor outputs in there. Sometimes I produce youtube videos :)
